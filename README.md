In this repo I will build my capstone project of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) Front End Engineer Degree.

## Overview of Udacity's "Front End Developer" Nanodegree Projects

- __Project 1:__ Building two  pages of a responsive blog design, first page blog overview, second page a blog post. Using HTML5 and CSS3 to publish a website. Focus: Responsive design with CSS Grid, flexbox and Media Queries.
- __Project 2:__ Using (Vanilla) JavaScript to make a website interactive and dynamic. With this project I could apply all my knowledge of JS and WebDev and deepen it immensively. I have built a website that detects sections of a page, highlights them, adds the detected sections to the navigation, adds a new section after clicking a button and more ... 
- __Project 3:__ Use asynchronous JavaScript (Async / Await) to fetch data from an API, in this case from www.openweathermap.org. It then chains multiple functions which are dependendent upon each other. 
- __Project 4:__ This project was extensive, I have used everything previously covered, especially asynchronous JS. I worked with __Webpack__ and thus created my functions as modules. The app ran on a development environment and a production environment. The server used __node.js__ as technology. I used __JEST__ for unit testing.
